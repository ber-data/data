        "description": "The partitioning of water inputs between deep and shallow groundwater flow paths is a fundamental processes, yet is challenging to observe. Numerical models provide a valuable tool to further develop insights on these groundwater mixing processes. This repository contains scripts to run the ParFlow-CLM and EcoSLIM integrated hydrologic models along the Pumphouse Hillslope in the East River Watershed and associated python scripts to process model outputs. Files includes input decks for the associated models, python scripts, and text and css files to support the model runs and processing. The 2-D hillslope model simulates from 2000 to 2021 using transient forcing conditions from the publicly available NLDAS-2 dataset. We develop an ensemble of models with variable hydrogeologic and soil parameters. Model outputs from the ensemble of runs are compared to to water level observations at the PLM1 and PLM6 wells published at (https://data.ess-dive.lbl.gov/view/doi:10.15485/1866836) and groundwater mean ages published at (https://data.ess-dive.lbl.gov/datasets/doi:10.15485/1960042. The model results are used to evaluate hillslope water mass-balance transience and mixing dynamics between groundwater flow paths with young (<10 year) and old (>10 year) ages.",

All stream and spring samples were collected between June and October, 2021, and the shallow, near stream piezometer sample was collected in July of 2022. These data were collected to evaluate how groundwater contributions to Coal Creek originating from shallow vs deep flow paths respond seasonal drying. Understanding of groundwater-surface water interactions in montane systems in critical for the future of water availability in the Western US as groundwater contributions are expected to become more important for sustaining summer stream flows. This data package contains: (1) a csv of all cation samples; (2) a csv of all anion samples; (3) a csv of all 87Sr/87Sr isotope samples; and (4) a csv of locations for each sampling site. The dataset additionally includes a file-level metadata (flmd.csv) file that lists each file contained in the dataset with associated metadata; and a data dictionary (dd.csv) file that contains column/row headers used throughout the files along with a definition, units, and data type.",

        "description": "TropiRoot 1.0 is a new tropical root database with root characteristics across environment gradients. It has data extracted from 107 new sources, resulting in more than 8000 rows of data (either species or community data). Most of the data in TropiRoot 1.0 includes root characteristics such as root biomass, morphology, root dynamics, mass fraction, architecture, anatomy, physiology and root chemistry. This initiative represents an approximately 30% increase in the currently available data for tropical roots in the Fine Root Ecology Database (FRED). TropiRoot 1.0, contains root characteristics from 25 different countries where seven are located in Asia, six in South America, five in Central America and the Caribbean, four in Africa, two in North America, and 1 in Oceania. Due to the volume of data, when ancillary data was available, including soil data, these data was either extracted and included in the database or their availability was recorded in an additional column. Multiple contributors checked the entries for outliers during the collation process to ensure data quality. For text-based observations, we examined all cells to ensure that their content relates to their specific categories. For numerical observations, we ordered each numerical value from least to greatest and plotted the values, checking apparent outliers against the data in their respective sources and correcting or removing incorrect or impossible values. Some data (soil and aboveground) have different columns for the same variable presented in different units, including originally published units, but root characteristics data had units converted to match the ones reported in FRED. By filling a gap from global databases, TropiRoot 1.0 expands our knowledge of otherwise so far underrepresented regions, and our ability to assess global trends. This advancement can be used to improve tropical forest representation in vegetation models.",

        "description": "In 2019, we measured the \u039414C and \u03b413C of soil respired carbon dioxide (CO2) in Panamanian forests that are subject to either in situ experimental soil warming (4C above ambient temperature to 1.2 m depth) or in situ experimental drying (50% throughfall exclusion). The warming site and one drying site are both within the Barro Colorado Nature Monument in nearby and similar forests on similar soils, enabling direct comparison of warming and drying effects on soil CO2 efflux. A second drying experiment is on the northern side of the Panama Isthmus on infertile soils where mean annual precipitation is greater, representative of a broad geographic area of the tropics. Given the seasonality of these forests, we performed measurements at stages of the seasonal cycle for which we expected the largest variation in CO2 efflux between control and experimental plots based on previous studies \u2013 the wet season (October-December) and dry season (March/April) or dry-to-wet season transition (May). This dataset includes \u039414C and \u03b413C of in situ soil surface CO2 flux as well as CO2 flux rates, volumetric soil moisture, soil temperature, and calculated partitioning of the fraction of total soil respiration from heterotrophs vs roots at the time of isotope sampling in AllSites_SoilResp_14C_data.xlsx. This dataset also includes \u039414C and \u03b413C of bulk soil, density fractions, and CO2 respired during laboratory incubations in AllSites_bulk_soil14C.xlsx. Datafiles are also available in csv format.",

        "description": "This is the version 1-2 Level 1 (L1) data release for COMPASS-FME environmental sensors located at our Terrestrial Ecosystem Manipulation to Probe the Effects of Storm Treatments (TEMPEST) experimental site. This manipulative, ecosystem-scale TEMPEST experiment addresses the potential for freshwater and estuarine-water disturbance events to alter tree function, species composition, and ecosystem processes in a deciduous coastal forest in MD, USA. The experiment uses a large-unit (2000 m2), un-replicated experimental design, with three 50 m\u2009\u00d7\u200940 m plots serving as control, freshwater, and estuarine-water treatments.\nL1 data are close to raw, but are units-transformed and have out-of-instrument-bounds and out-of-service flags added. Duplicates and missing data are removed but otherwise these data are not filtered, and have not been subject to any additional algorithmic or human QA/QC. Any scientific analyses of L1 data should be performed with care. **This dataset will be updated quarterly with new data for the duration of the project**\nThis dataset includes:\n- An overall dataset README file that describes the current version, gives citation and contact information, etc.\n- Site- and year-specific folders, each holding up to 12 CSV (comma separated value) data files for each site and plot in that year.\n- Metadata files within each site-year folder provide full information on data units, expected ranges, contact information, detailed flood times, as well as a general description of the site.\n- Environmental sensor types that appear in the data files include weather (ClimaVUE50, CS, RM Young, and LI instruments in the graphs below); soil conditions (TEROS12); soil redox state (Redox); groundwater variables (AquaTROLL200 and AquaTROLL600); open water sondes (Exo); tree sap velocity (Sapflow); and system voltage and state (Datalogger). Data are normally logged every 15 minutes.\nPlease see v1-2 TEMPEST L1 Sensor Package Quick Start.pdf for detailed information on data package structure, temporal coverage, and versioning.\nThe TEMPEST flood events occurred on the following dates. They lasted for ~10 hours each day and delivered ~80,000 gallons to each plot; many data streams are available at 1 or 5 minute frequency during these periods.\n* Tests: Aug 25 (fresh plot) and Sep 9 (salt plot), 2021\n* TEMPEST 1: June 22, 2022\n* TEMPEST 2: June 6-7, 2023\n* TEMPEST 3: June 11-13, 2024",

Dissolved oxygen and temperature measurements were made in the first few centimeters of wetland sediment to assess how oxygen profiles changed over time with hydrological events.\u00a0Measurements taken outside of the sediment were taken as comparison. Measurements were taken by hand with a PreSens Fibox 4 transmitter, paired with an oxygen dipping probe and temperature sensor, at each field outing. Measurements were taken approximately every 2 weeks around 10 AM EST. The PreSens_DO_Temp_Datafile.csv contains the recorded measurements, and the PreSens_InstallationMethods.csv describes the deployment of the sensor.",

COMPASS-FME is studying sites in two distinct regions, the Chesapeake Bay and the Western Lake Erie Basin. We established the network at seven \"synoptic\" (observational) sites along the Chesapeake Bay and Lake Erie coastlines, collectively generating over three million observations per month, to track and comprehend environmental changes where land and water intersect. Additionally, the two regions provide an interesting contrast of saltwater and freshwater coasts that allow us to differentiate the impacts of inundation and coastal water chemistries in two nationally important coastal systems.\nL1 data are close to raw, but are units-transformed and have out-of-instrument-bounds and out-of-service flags added. Duplicates and missing data are removed but otherwise these data are not filtered, and have not been subject to any additional algorithmic or human QA/QC. Any scientific analyses of L1 data should be performed with care. **This dataset will be updated quarterly with new data for the duration of the project**\nThis dataset includes:\n- An overall dataset README file that describes the current version, gives citation and contact information, etc.\n- Site- and year-specific folders, each holding up to 12 CSV (comma separated value) data files for each site and plot in that year.\n- Metadata files within each site-year folder provide full information on data units, expected ranges, contact information, as well as a general description of the site.\n- Environmental sensor types that appear in the data files include weather (ClimaVUE50, CS, RM Young, and LI instruments in the graphs below); soil conditions (TEROS12); soil redox state (Redox); groundwater variables (AquaTROLL200 and AquaTROLL600); open water sondes (Exo); tree sap velocity (Sapflow); and system voltage and state (Datalogger). Data are normally logged every 15 minutes.\nPlease see v1-2 Synoptic L1 Sensor Package Quick Start.pdf for detailed information on data package structure, temporal coverage, and versioning.",

        "description": "The NGEE-Arctic Tram operated from 2014 - 2018. It was installed on the Barrow Environmental Observatory in Barrow, Alaska in late May of 2014 and operated through mid-November 2014. The subsequent 2015 through 2018 years followed a similar schedule, but with different deployment dates and data gaps, with the goal always to capture the surface dynamics of the snow melt, growing, and freeze-up seasons. This Tram overview dataset has three objectives: (1) provide new data users with a brief description of the Tram system and its research purposes; (2) provide generally useful Tram site characterization details, including measurement position ground surface elevation, characteristics of the Arctic polygonal tundra under the Tram, vegetation community composition (future), and derived image products; and (3) reference all of the data products and archived datasets that were collected with the Tram-mounted sensors and co-located instruments. This dataset contains two csv files, two zipped files, one tif file, and one pdf file.\nThe Next-Generation Ecosystem Experiments: Arctic (NGEE Arctic), was a research effort to reduce uncertainty in Earth System Models by developing a predictive understanding of carbon-rich Arctic ecosystems and feedbacks to climate. NGEE Arctic was supported by the Department of Energy's Office of Biological and Environmental Research. The NGEE Arctic project had two field research sites: 1) located within the Arctic polygonal tundra coastal region on the Barrow Environmental Observatory (BEO) and the North Slope near Utqiagvik (Barrow), Alaska and 2) multiple areas on the discontinuous permafrost region of the Seward Peninsula north of Nome, Alaska. Through observations, experiments, and synthesis with existing datasets, NGEE Arctic provided an enhanced knowledge base for multi-scale modeling and contributed to improved process representation at global pan-Arctic scales within the Department of Energy's Earth system Model (the Energy Exascale Earth System Model, or E3SM), and specifically within the E3SM Land Model component (ELM).",

Porewater was collected by constructed sippers and deployed into the underlying soil of the wetland, and they were samples approximately every 2 weeks (when groundwater was present) in 2023. Surface water was collected approximately 1 inch below the surface of the water column (if available) via a syringe. Unfiltered and 0.45 micron filtered samples were collected. Samples were analyzed for various chemistry and is reported in the SWChem (surface water chemistry) and PWChem (porewater chemistry) .csv datafiles.

        "description": "Forest allocation of net primary productivity (NPP) to reproduction is poorly quantified globally, despite its critical role in forest regeneration and a well-supported trade-off with allocation to growth. Although field measurements of total NPP are rare, our work finds that a proxy for reproductive carbon allocation constructed from leaf (L) and reproductive (R) litterfall fluxes, R/(R+L), is strongly correlated with R/NPP, facilitating analysis across a wide range of sites where biometric estimates of NPP are not available (R\u00b2 = 0.85; Hanbury-Brown et al., 2022, Ward et al., in prep). To investigate relationships between ecosystem-scale reproductive allocation (RA) and climate, soil fertility, and stand age gradients, we conducted a literature search and synthesized 824 observations of annual average leaf and reproductive litterfall fluxes across forest sites globally. The zip file includes\n1) a folder Data/ containing one data (\"GlobalForestRA_data.csv\") and one metadata (\"GlobalForestRA_metadata.doc\") file.\nThe data file includes geographic coordinates, long-term mean annual temperature and precipitation (1970-2000, extracted from WorldClim2.1), leaf and reproductive litterfall fluxes, sampling interval and protocols, forest characteristics (dominant leaf morphology, information pertaining to forest age and successional stage, and disturbance history) and soil properties (% sand, %silt, %clay, total phosphorus (P), nitrogen (N), cation exchange capacity (CEC) and pH) extracted from SoilGrids250 and from on-site measurements, where available. The metadata file contains information about each variable reported in the data file, including data sources, processing methods, and all references.\n2) a folder Scripts/ which contains R scripts and functions used to produce results, figures, and tables in the manuscript Ward et al. (2025)\n3) a README file describing how the Data/ and Scripts/ can be used to reproduce statistical results, figures, and tables found in the manuscript. Ward et al.

        "description": "This data package contains raw leaf gas exchange data from the NGEE Tropics K34 tower site on a plateau near Manaus, Brazil. Data was collected using sensor and leaf sample measurements. Leaves on a target tree were chosen by accessing a branch near the tower. In some cases, the branch was naturally positioned near the tower and in other cases, a small rope was used to pull the branch closer to the tower for better access to leaves. Mature leaves were targeted in nearly all cases. The gas exchange system was hauled with a climbing rope to the level of the branch on the tower and the sensor head/leaf enclosure was installed near the branch of interest using a magic arm. We measured leaf gas exchange from 5:00 AM to 5:00 PM, randomly cycling through the approximately 20 leaves in the targeted branch(es). Data were collected over two time periods, detailed within the files. The attached data files contain raw data, sensor manuals, and PDFs with detailed methods and procedures separated into multiple folders. Data is in Excel file format.

        "description": "Landscape scale maps of plant community distribution at 5 m resolution were developed for southern Seward Peninsula. A Random Forest based environmental niche model was developed using topographic and climate data sets. Models were trained for the 2010-2019 period and applied to develop plant community distributions for contemporary (2010-2019) period. Trained model was applied to project the plant community distributions under future climate. Using downscaled projections for RCP8.5 scenario from five climate models (CCSM4, GFDL-CM3, GISS-E2-R, IPSL-CM5A-LR, MRI-CGCM3) and multi-model mean, a six member ensemble of plant community distribution were developed for current decade (2010-2019) and for future decades (2020-2029, 2030-2039, 2040-2049, 2050-2059).

It includes reference data for evaluating Landsat-based detection methods, supporting research on remote sensing approaches for identifying aufeis. The ReferenceData folder contains ArcGIS shapefiles of semi-automated land cover classifications for 217 Landsat Collection 2 images, categorizing pixels into six classes: aufeis, snow, ground, none, water, and cloud. The SiteBuffers.zip file includes 10-kilometer buffer shapefiles defining regions of interest around four aufeis fields (Canning21, FH1, Firth, and Kuparuk), used to test three detection techniques. Additionally, the TrainedRFModels folder contains six pre-trained Scikit-Learn Random Forest classifiers (100 trees, max depth = 30) designed to predict aufeis presence in Landsat Collection 2 Surface Reflectance images using Red, Blue, SWIR2, NDVI, and NDWI bands.

        "description": "This dataset supports a broader study examining hyporheic zone respiration rates to improve predictive models at a contiguous United States (CONUS) scale. The CONUS-Scale Model-Sample Study (CM) was designed following ICON (integrated, coordinated, open, and networked) principles to facilitate a model-experiment (ModEx) iteration approach, leveraging crowdsourced sampling across the CONUS. New machine learning models were created every month to guide sampling locations. Data from the resulting samples were used to test and rebuild the machine learning models for the next round of sampling guidance. Sampling began in April 2022 and ended in October 2023. In addition to the widely distributed CONUS sites, a more spatially focused sampling occurred in the Yakima River Basin, WA in summer 2022. Data from this more spatially intensive sampling occurred under the label \u201cSecond Spatial Study (SSS)\u201d and were also included in the machine learning models. Other data types collected from SSS that were not part of CM were published in a separate data package\nThis dataset is comprised of two folders with field photos and videos and one main data folder containing (1) file-level metadata; (2) data dictionary; (3) field metadata; (4) readme; (5) international generic sample number (IGSN) mapping file; (6) field protocols; (7) a subfolder with sample data; and (8) a subfolder with sensor data. The sample data subfolder contains (1) dissolved organic carbon (DOC, measured as non-purgeable organic carbon, NPOC) data and averages; (2) total nitrogen data and averages; (3) surface water major cations and anions and averages; (4) sediment grain size data; (5) sediment iron (II) data and averages; (6) wet sediment mass, dry sediment mass, water mass, and wet sediment volume in incubation vial; (7) sediment incubation respiration rate data and averages; (8) normalized respiration rate data and averages; (9) methods codes; (10) sediment specific surface area; (11) sediment percent carbon and nitrogen; (12) sediment gravimetric moisture and averages; (15) sediment X-ray diffraction (XRD) data; (16) sediment adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and averages; and (17) a subfolder with sediment incubation respiration data, scripts, and plots. The sensor data subfolder contains (1) a subfolder with miniDOT dissolved oxygen and temperature data and plots; (2) miniDOT dissolved oxygen and temperature summary data; and (3) miniDOT installation methods. All files are .csv, .pdf, .R, .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .mov, or .mp4.\nThis data package was originally published in February 2023. It was updated in June 2023 (v2; new and modified files); December 2023 (v3; new and modified files); and June 2024 (v4; new and modified files).

        "description": "This dataset supports a broader study examining the effects of wetting and drying on hyporheic zone respiration across the contiguous United States (CONUS). The dataset provides data generated from a laboratory moisture manipulation experiment. The contents include time series aerobic respiration and moisture; dissolved oxygen; sediment geochemistry data; and field metadata (including qualitative information on instream and river corridor characteristics).\nSamples were collected as part of the WHONDRS CONUS-Scale Model-Sample Study (CM). This study was designed following ICON (integrated, coordinated, open, and networked) principles to facilitate a model-experiment (ModEx) iteration approach, leveraging crowdsourced sampling across the CONUS. The data package associated with the CM study is available at\nThis dataset is comprised of one main data folder containing (1) file-level metadata; (2) data dictionary; (3) field metadata; (4) readme; (5) field protocol; and a (6) a subfolder with sediment sample data from the incubation experiment. The sample data subfolder contains (1) dissolved organic carbon (DOC, measured as non-purgeable organic carbon, NPOC); (2) total nitrogen (TN); (3) adenosine triphosphate (ATP); (4) percent carbon and nitrogen; (5) effect size; (6) iron (II); (7) gravimetric moisture; (8) respiration rates and raw dissolved oxygen values; (9) specific conductance; (10) pH; (11) temperature; (12) a summary containing median values of each data type for each treatment (wet and dry); (13) methods codes; (14) Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS) methods; and (15) a subfolder of 9 Tesla FTICR-MS. This folder contains two subfolders, one containing the .xml data files and the other containing instructions for using Formularity (https://omics.pnl.gov/software/formularity) and an R script to process the data based on the user's specific needs. All files are .csv, .pdf, .R, .ref, or .xml.",

        "description": "This dataset supports a broader study examining the drivers of spatial variability in sediment respiration rates in the Yakima River Basin. The dataset provides data and photos generated from sample collection during the same one-week period at 48 sites within multiple rivers throughout the Yakima River Basin in Washington, USA. The contents include surface water geochemistry data; river substrate grain size photos; stream depth data; manual chamber open channel respiration data; and field metadata (including qualitative information on instream and river corridor characteristics). Grain size photos can be used to improve estimates of channel substrate D50 data. The dataset also includes tensile strength and photos from cotton strip field degradation experiments; five-week sensor time series temperature, dissolved oxygen, pressure, pH, specific conductance, chlorophyll A, and turbidity data; plots of the sensor data; and R scripts used to generate the plots.\nSamples collected during this study were labeled as \u201cSecond Spatial Study\u201d or \u201cSSS.\u201d A subset of data from the SSS samples were published in the contiguous United States (CONUS)-Scale Model-Sample (CM) study data package available at https://data.ess-dive.lbl.gov/view/doi:10.15485/1923689 that presents data from across the CONUS. SSS data published in the CM data package were not included in this data package. They include dissolved organic carbon (DOC, measured as non-purgeable organic carbon, NPOC), total nitrogen (TN), grain size, aerobic sediment respiration, dissolved oxygen (DO), and temperature. Parent IDs and Site IDs are consistent between the SSS and CM data packages, and they can be mapped directly so data across packages can be used together. Additionally, sensor data from a similar 2021 spatial study can be found at https://data.ess-dive.lbl.gov/view/doi:10.15485/1892052 and 2021 sample data can be found at https://data.ess-dive.lbl.gov/view/doi:10.15485/1898914. The 2021 spatial study had some sites in common with this 2022 spatial study.\nThis dataset is comprised of three photo folders and one main data folder with six subfolders. The photo folders contain photographs and videos of cotton strip retrieval and sediment quadrats. The main data folder consists of (1) file-level metadata; (2) data dictionary; (3) field metadata; (4) total suspended solids (TSS) data and cotton strip tensile strength data and averages; (5) field protocol; (6) readme; (7) methods codes; (8) international generic sample number (IGSN) mapping file; (9) sensor installation methods summary; (10) stream depth and averages; and (11) Ultrameter data and averages. The Sonar subfolder consists of Sonar time-series depth data and a processing script. The BarotrollAtm, DepthHOBO, MantaRiver, miniDOT, and miniDOTManualChamber subfolders contain time-series data, plots, and summary files. All files are .csv, .pdf, .txt, .R, .Rmd, .jpg, .jpeg, .AVI, .mp4, or .mov.\nThe data package was originally published in April 2023. It was updated in August 2023 (v2; modified files) and September 2024 (v3; modified files). See the change history section in the readme for details.",
